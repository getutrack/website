When we start building Utrack, the ultimate goal is to build a modern advanced open-source core accounting system that has deep multiple dimensions financial statements and insightful analysis KPIs with the ability to integrate with other sales platforms (like Shopify and Stripe) and other banking systems to make Utrack the core financial backbone system that tracks the financial transactions of the business to generate concluded reports to the accountant and business owner for faster decision-making.

*In my opinion the great core accounting software should have*:

- **Insightful excellent financial statements**, three-dimensional reports, and analysis KPIs give top executives the concluded image about the current organization financial position.
- **Integration with other systems**, ability to integrate the accounting software with other sales, POSs, payment, or even payroll software to sync transactions automatically to the accounting system.
- **User interface** Modern accounting software should have an intuitive interface for all users, regardless of their tech or accounting skills.
- **Inventory Tracking**, Tracking the cost of goods using FIFO and the average cost is an essential service for most e-commerce companies or any company that sells physical goods to customers.

We're building core accounting software, with enjoyable modern user-experience, efficient financial statements and KPIs and more workflow automation.

Managing the finance of any organization is a crucial activity for business owners and accountants. Most accountants automate their repetitive tasks by software, covering areas such as A/R, A/P, transaction categorization, syncing transactions from different apps, and closing books to ensure accurate financial statements.

This is why accounting software is still one of the oldest and most popular types of software created. Many leading software solutions on the market were developed over a decade ago using old technologies, and the core accounting have not evolved significantly since then, despite tremendous evolvement in A/R, A/P, and payroll technologies.

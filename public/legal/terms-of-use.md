Utrack uses your data to provide our services to you.

- **Use of data**: When you enter or upload your data into our services, we don’t own that data but you grant us a licence to transmit, store, and back up all data you submit to us through our services, including personal data of yourself and others, to: enable you to use our services; allow us to improve, develop and protect our services; create new services; communicate with you about your subscription.

- **Use of your own personal data**: We respect your privacy and take data protection seriously. In addition to these terms, our privacy notice sets out in detail how we process your own personal data that you enter into Utrack, like your name and email address.

- **Use of personal data you enter about others**: Depending on where your contacts are based, our data processing terms may also apply to the personal data of others (such as your customers, vendors and employees) that you enter into Utrack.

- **Data breach notifications**: Where we think there has been unauthorised access to personal data inside your subscription, we’ll let you know and give you information about what has happened. Depending on the nature of the unauthorised access, and the location of your affected contacts, you may be required to assess whether the unauthorised access must be reported to the contact and/or a relevant authority. We think you’re best placed to make this decision, because you’ll have the most knowledge about the personal data stored in your subscription.
